An AutoHotkey script that shades (rolls up into the title bar) Windows windows like most X Windows window managers shade windows.

With this script, windows can be shaded/unshaded by:
* Double-clicking the title bar with the left mouse button
* Single-clicking the title bar with the middle mouse button
* Control-single-clicking anywhere inside a window with the middle mouse button
* Using the scroll wheel on the title bar:  up shades, down unshades
